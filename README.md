##### Address Manipulation

A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
A reference works as the same variable it is referencing but with other name. 

A pointer can be declared and assigned a value in different points of the code.
A reference needs to be assigned a value when it is declares (rule for some compilers).

A pointer can be re-assigned to another value.
A reference can't be re-assigned.

A pointer has a different memory address from the one it is pointing to.
A reference shares de same memory address with the variable it is referencing.
